## 1 Reflections


### 1.1 Shooting

**A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying:**

- She missed
- There was a panserscreen between them
- The man was already dead
- The man was Superman
- The man was saved at the hospital
- 

### 1.2 Alien

**An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can:**

- Find a toothbrush and toothpaste.
- Make sure you have access to water.
- Get your toothbrush wet with a little water.
- Squeeze a small amount of toothpaste onto your brush.
- Hold your toothbrush at an angle to your gums.
- Use small circles to brush all your teeth.
- Spend about 2 minutes brushing.
- Gently brush your tongue to freshen your breath.
- Spit out the toothpaste.
- Use a bit of water to rinse your mouth.
- Rinse your toothbrush under the tap.
- Let your toothbrush air dry.
- Brush twice a day, morning and night.
- Visit the dentist for check-ups.


## 3 Give your thoughts on TDD

**What was positive and good about using TDD?**
- TDD helps catch and address issues early in the development process. When a test fails, it's easier to pinpoint the problem since the failing test case provides specific information about the issue.

  
**What was annoying or difficult?**
- TDD can be very timeconsuming 

**What surprised you?**
- What's surprised me about TDD is that it often results in faster development and fewer bugs despite the initial time spent on writing tests.

**Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?**
- I think maybe that when not having testing/TDD in mind, I wouldn't have thougth of writing some tests, but not in this scenario.
